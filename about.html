        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>Hello there people of the world, my name is Dequan. And I live in Brooklyn New York. <br>
        And I'm here to help you learn how to play some songs on the guitar. I attend at City <br>
        Polytechnic High School in Downtown Brooklyn and an after school program called ScriptEd.<br>
        My hobbies include playing the guitar, playing Cardfight!! Vanguard with friends, and <br>
        playing videogames. My favorite foods are pizza, mac & cheese, and Johnny cake. Also my <br>
        favorite basketball team are the Miami Heat.</p>
